# 💻 System Monitor Client (React + Typescript + Vite)

A fast, minimalist React application for system monitoring, built with **Vite**. Perfect for React newcomers and developers looking for a quick start, modern tooling, and a real-world application structure.

## 🐍 Companion Backend (FastAPI)
This client is designed to communicate with a REST API to fetch real-time system metrics.

I built a fast, minimalist backend API using FastAPI, which is also key for FastAPI beginners or developers looking for a simple working starting template.

➡️ You can find that project here: [System Monitor API](https://github.com/louisehizojie/system-monitor-api)

## ✨ Features

* **⚡️ Lightning Fast Development:** Powered by **Vite** for incredibly fast hot module replacement (HMR).
* **⚛️ Modern React:** Utilizes React's functional components and hooks.
* **📊 Basic System Metrics:** A simple dashboard layout to display system data (e.g., CPU load, memory usage, network status). *(Note: Integration with a real backend/API would be required for live data).*
* **💅 Clean Structure:** A clear, easy-to-follow file and component organization.
* **🛠️ Ready to Deploy:** Simple build process for production.
